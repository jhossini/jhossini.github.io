            <h2>About Jo's</h2>
            <p>Jo's Crafthouse is a family-owned American tavern built for good times. Our globally-inspired menu
               features more than 50 made-from-scratch favorites, from shareable appetizers, entree salads, and
               specialty tacos, to flatbread pizzas, hot wings, gourmet sandwiches and signature burgers. Our team makes
               every meal by hand each day and a great passion goes into every plate that passes through our kitchen to
               your table. All of our sauces, dressings, and marinades are made from scratch each morning. Our burgers
               are a signature blend of chuck, brisket and hanger steak and our pizza dough is rolled and baked fresh
               daily. Our menu ranges from classic favorites with a twist to new, innovative items made approachable by
               design.
            </p>
            <p>Jo's features a high energy bar at the center of each restaurant. With a variety of tap handles
               featuring California's best craft beers, Jo's offers 30 draft brews with the majority of taps
               reserved for local and regional breweries. Jo's also features an extensive menu of hand-crafted
               signature cocktails made with fresh-squeezed juices and fresh-cut garnishes. Jo's also offers
               fresh-squeezed craft shooters and a diverse selection of California wines.
            </p>
            <p>The combination of our scratch kitchen and craft bar makes Jo's Crafthouse a comfortable and inviting
               gastropub that attracts guests of all types - especially a local crowd who can feel right at home.
               Jo's stylish setting is filled with a vibrant energy and lively atmosphere. Design features include
               100-year-old brick walls, reclaimed wood accents, antique copper bars, vintage photographs, TV's for
               sports viewing, and a custom soundtrack of rock & roll, reggae and country music. Our design is casual,
               inviting, and friendly where you will feel comfortable dressing it up or dressing it down.
            </p>
            <p>Founded in 2016 by Jordan Johnson, Jo's is proud to have expanded to
               multiple locations throughout Southern California. Jo's is open daily for lunch, dinner, happy hour
               and late-night dining. We are also kid-friendly, family-friendly, and dogs are always welcome on our
               patio.
